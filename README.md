# ecommerce

Written in React, NextJS, TypeScript accompanied by Tailwind.

## Todo

- Backend (Products, Authentication, Checkout)
- Rename core files (Basket naming schema (especially now with ./pages))
- Refactor Basket/Checkout components (Item and Summary)
- Core library (currencyFormatter)
- Fix VSCode File Formatter (tab inconsistencies)

## Startup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
